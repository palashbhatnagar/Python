**Introduction of Sagemaker**

**Amazon SageMaker** is a fully managed machine learning (ML) service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and confidently build, train, and deploy ML models into a production-ready hosted environment. It provides a UI experience for running ML workflows that makes SageMaker ML tools available across multiple integrated development environments (IDEs). 
With **SageMaker**, you can store and share your data without having to build and manage your servers. This gives you or your organizations more time to collaboratively build and develop your ML workflow and do it sooner. SageMaker provides managed ML algorithms to run efficiently against extremely large data in a distributed environment. With built-in support for bring-your-own algorithms and frameworks, SageMaker offers flexible distributed training options that adjust to your specific workflows. Within a few steps, you can deploy a model into a secure and scalable environment from the SageMaker console.

**Amazon SageMaker Pricing Explained**

**SageMaker** billing is based on a pay-as-you-go model. You pay only for the resources you use. There are no upfront fees or long-term commitments required. Instead, you can use the service on-demand to meet your dynamic needs. If you are not sure if the service suits your needs, you can use the Amazon SageMaker Free Tier to test it before committing long-term. The free tier provides a limited amount of resources each month for experimenting with each SageMaker feature.

**How Does Amazon SageMaker Pricing Work?**

Pricing for** Amazon SageMaker** is available in two billing options; Amazon SageMaker On-Demand or SageMaker Machine Learning Savings Plans. You can test the service for free in either case. The Amazon SageMaker Free Tier includes the following benefits for each SageMaker component:

1.	Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks – 250 hours on ml.t3.medium instances.
2.	SageMaker Notebook instances – 250 hours on ml.t2.medium or ml.t3.medium instances.
3.	SageMaker RStudio on SageMaker – 250 hours usage on ml.t3.medium instances for the RSession app, plus free usage of ml.t3.medium instance for the RStudioServerPro app.
4.	SageMaker Real-time inference – 125 hours usage on m4.xlarge or m5.xlarge instances.
5.	SageMaker Canvas – 750 hours each month devoted to sessions, and a maximum of ten model creation requests per month, each covering up to 1 million cells per model creation requests.
6.	SageMaker Serverless inference – 150,000 seconds usage of inference duration
7.	Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler – 25 hours of ml.m5.4xlarge instances usage.
8.	SageMaker Feature Store – 10 million write units, 10 million read units, and 25 GB storage.
9.	SageMaker Training – 50 hours usage on m4.xlarge or m5.xlarge instances.

The Amazon SageMaker On-Demand pricing approach charges per second, without a minimum charge, upfront payment, or contract. SageMaker On-Demand billing applies to 12 features:

1.	Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks
2.	SageMaker RStudio on SageMaker
3.	SageMaker Real-time inference
4.	SageMaker Asynchronous inference
5.	SageMaker Serverless inference
6.	SageMaker Notebook instances
7.	Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler
8.	SageMaker Processing
9.	SageMaker Batch Transform
10.	SageMaker JumpStart
11.	SageMaker Feature Store
12.	SageMaker Training

With Amazon SageMaker Machine Learning Savings Plans, you get flexible usage-based billing when you commit to a certain amount of usage (in $/hour) for one or three years. The Savings Plan rate can save you up to 64% off SageMaker ML On-Demand pricing. The On-Demand rate applies if you exceed your agreed commitment.
In addition, SageMaker ML Savings Plan rates are valid across multiple SageMaker ML usage instances, regardless of their size, region, or instance family. Those usage instances include:

1.	Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks
2.	Amazon SageMaker On-Demand Notebook
3.	SageMaker Data Wrangler
4.	SageMaker Processing
5.	SageMaker Training
6.	SageMaker Batch Transform
7.	SageMaker Real-Time Inference
8.	Also, SageMaker ML SPs come with flexible payment plans. 

Those plans are:

1.	All upfront – Get the highest discount by paying for the entire commitment in advance.
2.	Partial upfront – Put 50% down and pay the rest monthly.
3.	No upfront – Lock in predictable monthly costs with no money upfront — and still save.

Ultimately, the amount you pay with a SageMaker Savings Plan depends on the SageMaker component, payment plan, AWS region, and your commitment period (1 or 3 years).
